Scripts, workflows for extracting features from information streams

The intent is to summarize representations of the presidential attention and action from disparate media environments in order to:
* compare features across information streams;
* investigate means of "reading" across divergent ideological perspectives
* explore methods of visualizing the extracted information to facilitate exposure to a wider array of news;
* ... and more.

The repository will contain:
* Descriptions of the data/text sources (much of the raw news text cannot be shared freely, but those with access to the same databases can replicate the queries; other information streams are publicly available)
* R scripts for reading in the text and creating a corpus
* R scripts for exploring and cleaning the corpus
* R scripts for sentiment analysis on corpus
* R scripts for topic modelng on corpus
* ... more to come.

If you're interested in contributing to the project, we'd love to talk to you!
