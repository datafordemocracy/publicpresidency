# Acquring Wall Street Journal articles about President Trump

We pulled the Wall Street Journal articls from Factiva, licensed through the UVA Libary.

We used the following for the search:
* In Source we selected "The Wall Street Journal",
* in Dates we chose "Enter date range" and entered dates encompassing the fisrt and last day of each month,
* we set Duplicates to "Identical", and
* in the Free Text Search field we used "trump/F100/" to capture articles where the word trump appeared within the first 100 words.

Hit search to return results, and sort the results by date. In Factiva we can only download 100 articles at at time.^1 We
* checked the box at the top of the list to select the first 100 articles shown,
* go to Display Options on the right and choose "Full Article/Report plus Indexing",
* hit the save button, choosing "Article Format",
* right-clicked the resulting results to save in the WSJ project directory,
* then hit "Next 100" and repeated the process (after the first or second save, we had to prove we weren't a robot each time).
