- Looked into available hate crime data sets. It'd be interesting to correlate news/social media speech with offline activity.
  - [FBI hate crime statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime), available from 1995-[2015](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015). No more recent data available.
  - [Southern Poverty Law Center](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/12/16/update-1094-bias-related-incidents-month-following-election) (SPLC)'s curation of nation-wide hate incidents in the month following the election. No more recent data available.
  - [Slate's curation of hate incidents](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2016/12/hate_in_america_a_list_of_racism_bigotry_and_abuse_since_the_election.html) includes individual incidents motivated by racism, misogyny, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, and anti-immigrant sentiment. The list is updating.

- Topic/policy areas:
  - **Mass shooting**: a good interactively illustrated [compilation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/mass-shootings-in-america/) dating back to 1966; another interactive report "Behind the Bloodshed" can be found [here](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/mass-killings/index.html#frequency). There are three recent mass shootings whose casualities were greater than 20 people.  1) Orlando shooting, Jun 12 2016, 49 victims; 2) Las Vegas shooting, Oct 1 2017, 58 victims; 3) Sutherland Springs shooting, Nov 5 2017, 25 victims. Most mass shootings killed less than 10 people. Maybe interesting to compare Orlando with Las Vegas; but recent incidents are limited.
  - **Foreign policy**: can compare online reaction to interactional presidential trips; a compilation can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump). Trump has gone on three main trips since election: 1) May trip to Middle East and Europe (SA, IS, BE, IT); 2) July trip to Europe (PO, DE, FR); 3) November trip to Asia (JP, SK, CN, VN, PP)

- Conducted tf-idf analysis of right and left reddit posts regarding Charlottesville (stories), focused on 1) salient and distinctive words utilized by both sides; 2) tf-idf based document similarity, its correlation with political alignment, and network visualization. See stories_tfidf.R for code; can serve as building blocks for future analysis such as moral foundation analysis.
